This is just a repository to hold some of my standard Windows config files.
They are committed to the public domain with CC0 license, so please help yourself (No warranty is implied).

These would typically go in your home directory, which might be specified with the `%HOME%` envvar, or the
combination of the `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` envvars, or else by the `%USERPROFILE%` envvar. By default, this is typically
`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\` on Windows 7.
